and/or projects) organized by one or several lecturers at Paris-Saclay University.
- The program encompasses
Offered Courses
• A number of courses called “mandatory”
• A number of courses called “optional”
- The courses and their ECTS credit numbers are proposed by the program coordinators,
in agreement with the lecturers.
- The courses are displayed on the Web page of the program.
- All obligatory courses will necessarily take place.
- The optional courses are not guaranteed to
take place (they may or may not start, depending on the number of interested students, and
other factors).
- One optional course is the “Module Liberté”. It is a placeholder for any data-
oriented course at Paris-Saclay University, subject to the approval of the program coordinators.
- A student can follow at most one Module Liberté.
- The Module Liberté will necessarily take
place.
- The Module Liberté is worth a predetermined number of ECTS credits, no matter how
many credits are awarded by the program that offers the course. 
- Courses typically take place
in the ﬁrst semester of the study year.
- Students that are not registered for the program can
participate in the courses at the discretion of the lecturer.

## Examinations

- A course is evaluated by examinations.
- An examination can be a midterm
exam, a ﬁnal exam, projects, homeworks, graded practical labs, presentations or similar items.
- Each examination is graded on a 0-20 scale, with 20 being the maximal grade and 10 the pass-
ing grade. 
- The following applies to all courses except for the Module Liberté.
- Each course
offers two rounds of examinations. - Exams of both rounds take place during predetermined
periods.
- For each round, the lecturer deﬁnes a grading scheme, i.e., (1) the examinations that
play into the grade of the round and (2) the weight of these examinations for the grade of
the round.
- The grading scheme of the second round can include examinations from the ﬁrst
round.
- The lecturer communicates the grading schemes to the program coordinators before
the start of the study year.
- The grading schemes are displayed on the Web page of the pro-
gram at most one month after the start of the study year.
- If a student commits a fraud in
an examination (including plagiarism), the grade of this examination is zero.
- If the student
copied from another student of the course, the other student also receives a grade of zero for
this examination.
- Upon request by either the students or the lecturer, the case is referred to
the jury.
- The jury can either exonerate the students, or ask the reference institute to apply
the sanctions for fraud that it has put in place for its diploma program.
